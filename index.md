## **Behind The Scenes: UGC Items**

Ever wondered what the process was to uploading a UGC item to Roblox? Well in this article we'll be showing you from getting the idea to actually releasing your own UGC Creations!

### **What does it take to be a UGC Creator and how do I apply?**

To be a UGC Creator, you need to have some experience in modeling *(why not start now if you didn't already?)* to be able to get accepted by Roblox since uploading an item is not available to everyone. As I'm writing this post [applications are open](https://roblox.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_56I0Jyo6Pz3ksUS), if not, [this DevForum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) should announce when they'll be open. 

### **UGC Creation process:**

#### **What you'll need**
- 3D Software ([Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the most popular)
- Texturing Software (*This is optional as you can use the tools in Blender but here's an alternative:* [Adobe Substance Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html))
- Image Editing Software ([Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/))

#### **Steps to creating the model**
1. Start off by getting a new and original idea. Once you have an idea to work off with, I suggest getting some references of any images that can help you with creating the design.
2. Create a basic shape of your item without any big details, a low poly piece to prepare for the next stage.
3. Use Blender's remesh filter to increase the triangle count and fix any "artifacts" which are basically visual issues, then use the sculpt tool to smooth the model out and create higher quality details.
4. When the model has been sculpted, it will probably still have too many triangles to upload on Roblox (more detail on that later). Most UGC Creators use something called "Retorpology" which is the process of simplifying the topology of a mesh to make it cleaner and easier to work with, in other words, placing lower qualityy faces on top.
5. Now that you have a lower quality mesh which has less triangles you can do something called "Baking" which makes the lower quality model have the  same lighting and details as the high quality mesh.
