## **Behind The Scenes: UGC Items**

Ever wondered what the process was to uploading a UGC item to Roblox? Well in this article we'll be showing you from getting the idea to actually releasing your own UGC Creations!

### **What does it take to be a UGC Creator and how to apply?**

To be a UGC Creator, you need to have some experience in modeling *(why not start now if you didn't already?)* to be able to get accepted by Roblox since it's not available to everyone. As I'm writing this post [applications are open](https://roblox.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_56I0Jyo6Pz3ksUS), if not [this DevForum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) should announce when they'll be open. 

### **UGC Creation process:**

#### **What you'll need**
- 3D Software ([Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the most popular)
- Texturing Software (*This is optional as you can use the tools in Blender but here are some other popular alternatives:* GIMP, 
- Image Editing Software (
#### **Getting started**
Start off by getting a new and original idea. Copying something that has already been made might get you banned. Plus, people like original content.

Once you have an idea to work off with, I suggest getting some references of other items without copying them. Import them in your 3D software
