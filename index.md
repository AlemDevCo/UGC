## **Behind The Scenes: UGC Items**

Ever wondered what the process was to uploading a UGC item to Roblox? Well in this article we'll be showing you from getting the idea to actually releasing your own UGC Creations!

### **What does it take to be a UGC Creator and how do I apply?**

To be a UGC Creator, you need to have some experience in modeling *(why not start now if you didn't already?)* to be able to get accepted by Roblox since uploading an item is not available to everyone. As I'm writing this post [applications are open](https://roblox.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_56I0Jyo6Pz3ksUS), if not, [this DevForum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) should announce when they'll be open. 

### **UGC Creation process:**

#### **What you'll need**
- 3D Software ([Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the most popular)
- Texturing Software (*This is optional as you can use the tools in Blender but here's an alternative:* [Adobe Substance Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html))
- Image Editing Software ([Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/))
- [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create)


#### **NOTICE:** This article is meant for people that have basic understanding in the softwares above and know how to use them fluently.

#### **Creating the model**
*Programs used: 3D Software (Blender)*
1. Start off by getting a new and original idea. Once you have an idea to work off with, I suggest getting some references of any images that can help you with creating the design.
2. Create a basic shape of your item without any big details, a low poly piece to prepare for the next stage.
3. Use Blender's remesh filter to increase the triangle count and fix any "artifacts" which are basically visual issues, then use the sculpt tool to smooth the model out and create higher quality details.
4. When the model has been sculpted, it will probably still have too many triangles to upload on Roblox (more detail on that later). Most UGC Creators use something called "Retorpology" which is the process of simplifying the topology of a mesh to make it cleaner and easier to work with, in other words, placing lower qualityy faces on top.
5. Now that you have a lower quality mesh which has less triangles you can do something called "Baking" which makes the lower quality model have the  same lighting and details as the high quality mesh. 

#### **Texturing**
*Programs used: 3D Software (Blender), Texturing Software (Adobe Substance Painter) Image Editing Software (Paint.net)*
1. To prepare for texturing, you need to UV unwrap the low quality mesh, in other words, unfolding or unwrapping the 3D model at the seams and laying it flat on a 2D space. Make sure nothing is messed up.
2. Import your 3D model in your Texturing Software. This can envolve hand drawing colors onto the model or creating generated materials that have a realistic appearance.
3. If the texture-image is not how you want it to be, use an image editing software to tweak it.

#### **UGC Tweaking**
Unfortunately I've spoken with a few UGC Creators and they all told me that this part can't be disclosed.

#### **Uploading**
*Programs used: Roblox Studio*
Uploading is the same process as uploading a Plugin to the Toolbox. You right click it and upload it. 
**Maximum Triangles:** 4,000
**Uploading Fee:** 750 Robux
**Waiting Period:** 1-2 Business days
